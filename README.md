# pirl-allowance


# Purpose
To create a simple smart-contract DAPP that will help manage allowance distributions from parents to kids. This is mostly to provide some motivation to create my first DAPP.


# Use Cases
* Parent initiates the contract
* Parent adds children (1 or more)
* Parent adds tokens to their account
* Child requests allowance
* Allowance is approved and dispersed to the child 'account'


# Project Timeline
* Refine Use Cases with guidance from someone that has an informed opinion
* Set up testnet and development environment
* Build basic contract instantiation and tests
* Build tests and matching skeleton contract functions that return desired results
* Code the functions
* Build a UI for the parent features
* Build a UI for the child features
