# pirl-allowance


# Purpose
To create a simple smart-contract DAPP that will help manage allowance distributions from parents to kids. This is mostly to provide some motivation to create my first DAPP.


# Use Cases
## Parent initiates the contract
## Parent adds children (1 or more)
## Parent adds tokens to their account
## Child requests allowance
## Allowance is approved and dispersed to the child 'account'


# Project Timeline
## Refine Use Cases with guidance from someone that has an informed opinion
## Set up testnet and development environment
## Build basic contract instantiation and tests
## Build tests and matching skeleton contract functions that return desired results
## Code the functions
## Build a UI for the parent features
## Build a UI for the child features
